# Arabidopsis-Variant-DB-REST-API
 A relational database for storing variant information from VCF files of different *Arabidopsis thaliana* strains and a REST API service for convenient access to this information.

## Database
The SQLite (v3.34.1) engine was employed to establish a relational database, aiming to store critical data extracted from VCF (v4.1) files originating from different *Arabidopsis thaliana* strains. The database was designed with a straightforward structure to streamline both data population and query processes.
